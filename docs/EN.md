## siyakat

This directory contains algorithms and usage examples of the siyakat encryption technique that has gained the ability to encrypt digital data.

---

### Algorithm

**Encryption algorithm**
* Data is converted to Hex code
* Miftah is taken to the loop and every character of the Hex code is replaced by miftah
* The transformed value is converted to the Hex code again and made suitable for other miftah operations.

**Solution algorithm**
* The miftah sequence is replaced in the opposite direction.
* The Miftah is taken to the loop and the encrypted parameter is processed to be converted to Miftah switch, which is performed depending on the number of miftah.After each process, the Hex code is converted to readable.
